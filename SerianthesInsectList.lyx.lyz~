Camphor scale, Pseudaonidia duplex , was detected on Guam in September 2014.
 This armored scale was found infesting seedlings of the endangered tree
 Serianthes nelsonii growing in a nursery at the University of Guam.
 This is the first record for this insect from Guam and the rest of Micronesia
 and the first report of it attacking this host.
 The scale likely orginates from Asia and was reported from Hawaii and Californi
a in 1908.

Recently Arrived Bark Beetles Attacking Guam’s Native Trees
\series default
 In 2011, UOG entomologist, Aubrey Moore, used a coffee berry borer trap
 baited with ethanol and methanol to survey for bark beetles on Guam.
 The single trap, placed for two months, caught seven species of bark beetles,
 3 of which were new island records.
 In 2014, US Forest Service funded Ruddy Estoy, Guam Department of Agriculture,
 Division of Forestry and Soil Resources, to install and monitor bark beetle
 and woodborer detection traps as part of the US Forest Service Early Detection/
 Rapid Response program.
 Twelve bark beetle species were identified from this effort, 5 are apparently
 new island records.
 Impacts of these new bark beetles on Guam’s forests are unknown.
 However, one of the species first detected in 2014, Xylosandrus compactus
 , the black twig borer, was found in 2015 attacking Serianthes nelsonii
 saplings in the Guam Plant Extinction Prevention Program (GPEPP) nursery
 operated by Dr.
 James McConnell at the University of Guam (Figure 7).
 S.
 nelsonii is a critically endangered plant with only a single mature tree
 remaining on Guam.
 GPEPP is propagating S.
 nelsonii in an attempt to save this species and other rare, native forest
 plants.
 Attacks by invasive species, many of which are recent arrivals, are hampering
 GPEPP’s conservation efforts, both in the nursery and in out-plantings.
